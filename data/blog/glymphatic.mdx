## Quote of the Post

> If Louis Pasteur were to come out of his grave because he heard that the cure for cancer still had not been found, NIH would tell him, “Of course we'll give you assistance. Now write up exactly what you will be doing during the three years of your grant.” Pasteur would say, “Thank you very much,” and would go back to his grave. Why? Because research means going into the unknown. If you know what you are going to do in science, then you are stupid! This is like telling Michelangelo or Renoir that he must tell you in advance how many reds and how many blues he will buy, and exactly how he will put those colors together. – Albert Szent-Gyorgi


I’ll start this off with something of a preface. I am not a neuroscientist. I have never been in a lab, and I may never well work in a lab. Sometimes, some of the stuff I read feels like what you see in an instructional manual for a machine you will never use. Alas, someday I will have to make money off this shit, so I might as well understand how to read research articles. So we begin. In a lot of neuroscience work on the internet I read, you hear about synaptic connections, and neurotransmitters and their associated receptors, but it seems like I never see anything that tries to take on the complete architecture of the blood vessels and the fluids that move in these blood vessels and tries to elucidate their purpose. This is the first time I've heard about the glymphatic system, so I'm excited.

The first important thing I notice about this article is AQP4 (Aquaporin 4 water channels). Wikipedia pic coming up. It looks like licorice, I have no idea what its doing electrically, how it sticks to the membrane, and how scientists even know it exists. This could all be fiction for all I know. You know when you slide down from your tree house, and your ass hurts a little bit. I wonder if AQP4 feels that when it moves down a membrane. Or does it feel that every time a water molecule slips in and out, is it bored of the mundane activity it has to perform until its host dies, or does it just do it, like a mom who has to cook but hates it? Read on.

The second thing I notice is directional transport. Directional transport? What the hell? How in the world does fluid move one directionally in the glymphatic system? Is there a self cleansing mechanism for the fluid once it reaches the brain, some enzyme that cleans up the fluid once our brain extracts what it deems useful? Let’s find out together. Read on. 

Also important, we don’t really understand the fluid patterns that occur in the brain of a living human being, but we do know that Cerebrospinal fluid has a major influx after a stroke or cardiac arrest, so we don’t even have a clear picture of the brain of living person after taking their histological slices. 
Why does glymphatic CSF flow run in the same direction as blood flow? Wouldn’t countercurrent exchange make more sense here? I feel like nutrients in the fluid would be more effectively used in the body, but I assume that Glymphatic flow is probably not the only fluid flow occurring in the brain. I still don’t know what makes astrocytes classified as astrocytes, but apparently they have these important AQP4 channels that move must of this CSF fluid. 

Additionally, can I see a good picture of the perivascular space? This paper keeps talking about it, but the brain is so mooshed about I don’t even know where it is. After some Googling, it seems to be the space surrounding blood vessels.

Scientists have apparently fucked up by not modeling this space properly, focusing on how to model it from histological sections (dead brains), which have considerably smaller perivascular spaces that people who are—well living. Seems like an important problem, especially when a living animal has a perivascular space ten times larger than its dead counterpart. Its also not that circular, its got more of an ellipses-like shape. Alas, scientists who have used the wrong assumptions in your model, don’t freak out, as its still okay to use your data for comparisons between animals apparently, since now most mammal die, and the blood vessels undergo more or less the same changes when they die. Okay, I don’t know if I want to assume that, but I’m to lazy to check into it further.

Onto, the next thing, the AQP4 water channel I previously mentioned. They say AQP4 deals with the transport of water, but they also make it seem like it moves CSF. Which is it buddy? Also, WTF is a neuropil. Bookmark that for later. Glymphatic finally gets an explanation for its weird name, which I also saw used in the movie Awake (2021, don’t watch it because it sucks), and it came from the fact glial cells are important for cerebrospinal fluid influx and interstitial fluid efflux levels in the brain of MICE. MICE. I swear, sometimes it feels like neuroscience is like astrology in the 1200’s. It looks cool, sounds interesting and specific, and it may be completely useless for super specific parts of the human mind. Like, do we really think we will learn anything about tanks by looking at how doors in a Honda civic are designed? We may understand how the gas pedal works in a car and a tank, but the more specific we get, the more it feels like I’m an emperor in the third century waiting to start my campaign on the word of some Rainman level astrologist using advanced mathematical formulas in order to determine whether it’s a good day to start my conquest.

The neuropil has lots of synapses, glial cells, and dendrites, and not a lot of cell bodies. It is a region with a high density of synapses and unmyelinated axons, so there is no myelin to increase conductivity but that is probably balanced by the higher number of synapses per unit area. Fluid movements in the brain indicate that there is convective flow of solutes around the neuropil, however it is not known whether it occurs in the neuropil. Convective flow is the flow of fluid through a porous membrane (think a tube that leaks fluid through the side). Convective flow and diffusion each play a role in the flow of fluids in the glymphatic system. However, organisms perform so many different behavioural processes, who knows whether diffusion takes charge when you breathe vs convective flow taking charge when you piss?

Does the research taking place actually makes sense? The reviewers ask this question a lot. Injecting tracers in animals seems like it tells you where fluid is travelling, but the reviewers argue whether this leads to an artificial increase in fluid, tainting the results from these experiments. However, the reviewers argue that this is probably not the case. 

Finally, this paper would not be a neuroscience paper without some sort of discussion about amyloid beta and tau. I’ve heard so much about these two molecules and I’m only in my first real year of neuroscience. Nobody talks about the neuroscience of fevers, or sex, or things we do on a daily basis, they’re too fucking complicated. But talk about Alzheimer’s, and my educators get excited. The cleanup of these molecules seems dependent on the glymphatic system. Those glial cells clear these chemicals that are dangerous if they build up, and they do it when we sleep. Miss a night of sleep, and get one step closer to dementia. Just kidding—but seriously, stop fucking reading this and get some sleep.

One major question I have. Who moves more neurotransmitters on a daily basis, or is it by a specific behaviour? The glymphatic system, cranial nerves, blood vessels in the brain, or regular old axons in the brain? Importantly, the glymphatic system is one of the primary clearance mechanisms of the brain, that’s why people care about it.

On to the next, thanks for reading.
